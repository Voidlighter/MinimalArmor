This pack changes iron, gold, diamond, netherite, leather, and chainmail armor 
textures so that the player's skin won't be nearly as obstructed by the armor. 
The armor is meant to still be visible so that in for example a PVP situation 
it is still easily understood how much armor is being worn by the other person.

Elytra has also been changed to be more minimal, while still retaining some of 
the original feel.

The biggest addition in this update is that all armor trims have been accounted 
for! They don't all retain everything special about them (especially cool designs
you'd find on the chestplate) but they all retain as much of the trimmed look as
I was able to without adding too much more surface to the armor.

I also made all the helmets into armor going around the neck, with varying levels
of fancy and frill to match the different armor types. I left the leather cap as a
cap for now â€” That one doesn't come up as often in survival, and if you want to
dye it, you'd probably want to see it better.

I also didn't change the Turtle Helmet, cuz I like it, it's just a fun turtle hat.


Thanks so much for downloading this pack! I hope you enjoy it!

I was super surprised to see some YouTubers I follow like MumboJumbo and Grian
using this pack, and after I saw more of the community asking about when it'd be
updated, I finally had the motivation (and time) to get around to updating it.

If you want to support me, I could use all the follows and subscribers I can get!
### I'd love if you could credit me too if you use this texture pack in videos!
